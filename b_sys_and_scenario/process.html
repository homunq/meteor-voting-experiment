	<p>The following is an experiment in voting behavior. Should you choose to participate,
the experiment will take under 25 minutes total, and you will be paid a base rate of 
${{baserate}}.
You will also have 2 opportunities to gain a reward of up to 
${{maxprize}}. 
The average total payment of participants will be somewhere from 
${{minaverage}}
to
${{maxaverage}} 
each. Because your reward will depend on the behavior of other participants and the group
to which you are assigned, it may be impossible for you to win a reward, and so your
entire compensation could be as little as
${{baserate}}.</p>

<p>You will gain no direct benefit from this research besides your payment and anything
you might learn about voting systems. Your actions in this experiment will be
analyzed and published to help increase scientific understanding of voter behavior.
The data will also be saved for possible comparison with future studies or other
analysis. At the end of the experiment, you will have an opportunity to opt in to
receive a short summary of the findings when available, using Mechanical Turk's
anonymous communication system; this is entirely your choice and will have no
effect on payment. Your anonymity will be safeguarded by Mechanical Turk. The
investigators will not receive any identifying information and if they do due to some
error, they will immediately destroy it. You will only be allowed to participate in this
experiment once.</p>

<p>Please understand that participation in research is completely voluntary. You are
free to decline to take part in the project. You can explicitly decline to answer any
questions without any penalty of any kind, and this assignment will still be counted
as complete on Mechanical Turk. You are free to stop taking part in the project at
any time and you will be paid based on the fraction of the allotted time you have
spent, with no bonus payments; in that case, this will count as an incomplete
assignment, but will not affect your percentage of accepted assignments.</p>

<p>If you have any questions about the above, you may contact either of the
researchers:</p>
