.....


Borda ballot lines are blank
		also score

faction is sometimes null (second reload?)
		eid and step are "correct"
		picture is broken (duh)
		also, all payoffs are $1.08
		after "wasntMe" is one of various times it can happen
		
loading second user with a pre-used workerId into a new election can hang on "loading" 
			(about 10 lines of debugging - up to "isServer: false timeOffset 2"... 
			user has just id and username....
			straight reload fixes...)
			reproducible
			straight reload sometimes doesn't fix...
			theory: this is when there was an existing user, loginThen not called.
			penultimate message: gonna login_then 1; 
			logout() and reload fixes
			
x		Chrome freezes on "waiting for 1 other voter, or until ...."
		just when update should happen???
		gah, chrome freezes, how do I debug that?
		reproducible
		after timer, before findAndJoin
			Resolution: was continually recreating StepRecord in 1st processHelpers autosubscribe
			
doesn't jump past consent when you take HIT
		has to do with processHelpers autosubscribes
		
2 vote, one is "waiting", other is "you already voted" but doesn't register, both stuck.

after "wasntMe", 

x					"waiting" countdown counts by 10s... heh, that works
