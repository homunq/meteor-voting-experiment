		<h2>Election Method: Instant Runoff Voting</h2>
		<h3>Ballot</h3>
		<p><strong>The ballot will ask you to rank the candidates in order of preference.</strong> 
		So you would rank the candidate you wish to help the most as 1, the next as 2, and so on.
		Any candidate whom you do not explicitly rank will never get your vote.</p>
		<h3>Counting</h3>
		<p>Each candidate will get a pile of all the ballots that rank them first. If no pile is more than half
			the votes, then the ballots in the smallest pile will be reassigned
			to the candidate they rank next, if any. Any of these ballots which do not include a next choice will
			be counted as "exhausted". This process will repeat until one candidate has more than half
			of the non-exhausted ballots.</p>
			<p>The first candidate to get more than half of the remaining ballots wins.</p>
