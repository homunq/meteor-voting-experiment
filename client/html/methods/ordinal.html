<template name="IRV_blurb">
		<h3>Election Method: Instant Runoff Voting</h3>
		<p><em>Also known as IRV, RCV, or the Alternative Vote</em></p>
		<h4>Ballot</h4>
		<p><strong>The ballot will ask you to rank the candidates in order of preference.</strong> 
		So you would rank the candidate you wish to help the most as 1, the next as 2, and so on.
		Any candidate(s) whom you do not explicitly rank will be ranked last.</p>
		<h4>Counting</h4>
		<p>For each candidate, the votes which ranked that candidate 1 are tallied. If any candidate tallies over
			half the votes, they win. Otherwise, the candidate site with the lowest tally is eliminated, and its votes
			are re-tallied for whichever they ranked second.</p>
			<p><strong>The first candidate to get more than half of the remaining ballots wins.</strong></p>
			<p><small>Fine print: If a ballot ranked the eliminated candidate first but does not have a second-ranked candidate, 
				that ballot is discarded. If there are two candidates equally eligible for elimination, one is chosen randomly.</small></p>
</template>


<template name="IRV_stratBlurb">
	<ul>
		<li>
			In IRV (this voting system), it can never hurt you to explicitly rank all three candidates. Your lower
			ranks will never count against your higher ranks.
		</li>
		<li>
			If you fear your least-favorite option is likely to win, and your second choice has a better chance of beating
			it than your first choice, it can sometimes be advantageous to rate your true second choice in first place,
			to help protect them from premature elimination.
		</li>
	</ul>
</template>

<template name="borda_blurb">
		<h3>Election Method: Borda Voting</h3>
		<p><em>Also known as the Borda count</em></p>
		<h4>Ballot</h4>
		<p><strong>The ballot will ask you to rank the candidates in order of preference.</strong> 
		So you would rank the candidate you wish to help the most as 1, the next as 2, and so on.
		Any candidate(s) whom you do not explicitly rank will be ranked last.</p>
		<h4>Counting</h4>
		<p>The candidate you rank first will get 3 points from you; the one you rank second will get 2 points; and third place
			gets 1 point.</p>
			<p><strong>The candidate with the most points wins.</strong></p>
			<p>(In Borda voting each rank is always worth 1 more point than the one below, so if there were 10 candidates,
				first place would be worth 9 points.)</p>
</template>

<template name="borda_stratBlurb">
	<ul>
		<li>
			In Borda Voting (this voting system), it is strategic to focus on the two candidates you think have the best
			chance of winning.
		</li>
		<li>
			Of those two, you should vote the one you prefer as high as possible, and the other one as low as possible.
		</li>
	</ul>
</template>


<template name="condorcet_blurb">
		<h3>Election Method: Condorcet Voting</h3>
		<p><em>(Minimax Condorcet)</em></p>
		<h4>Ballot</h4>
		<p><strong>The ballot will ask you to rank the candidates in order of preference.</strong> 
		So you would rank the candidate you wish to help the most as 1, the next as 2, and so on.
		Any candidate(s) whom you do not explicitly rank will be ranked last.</p>
		<h4>Counting</h4>
		<p>Each candidate will be compared to each other candidate to see which is preferred by more voters.</p>
			<p><strong>If there is one candidate which wins against each of the others, that site wins.</strong> 
				Otherwise, the candidate which loses by the least will win.</p>
			<p>For instance, if you vote X:1, Y:2, Z:3, your vote will be tallied for X in the X vs Y race and the X vs Z race,
				 and for Y in the Y vs Z race.</p>
</template>

<template name="condorcet_stratBlurb">
	<ul>
		<li>
			In Condorcet voting, as long as there's one candidate which could beat all the others one-on-one, it's strategic
			to rank your favorite candidate at the top.
		</li>
		<li>
			Occasionally, there can be strategic benefit in rating your second choice at bottom. If this causes a cycle,
			where your favorite beats your least favorite, who beats your second choice, who beats your favorite,
			it is possible (though not certain) that your favorite candidate could come out as the winner. However, doing
			this also carries strategic risk; you could help your least-favorite site to win.
		</li>
	</ul>
