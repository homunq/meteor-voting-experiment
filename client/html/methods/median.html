		<h3>Election Method: Majority Approval Voting</h3>
		<p><em>Also known as MAV.</em></p>
		<h4>Ballot</h4>
		<p><strong>The ballot will ask you to grade each
		candidate (site) on a scale from A (excellent) to F (unacceptable).</strong> You may give two candidates the
		same grade if you wish. Any candidate whom you do not explicitly grade will get an F from you.</p>
		<h4>Counting</h4>
		<p>To find the winner, first the "A" votes for each candidate are counted. If no
		candidate gets 50% or more of the voters, the "B" votes are added to the count, then "C"
		votes, etc. <strong>The first candidate to get 50% or more is the winner.</strong>
		If two candidates would reach 50% at the same
		grade, whichever of them has more votes at higher grades wins.</p>
		
		<p>This process ensures that the winner will be one of the candidates with the <strong>highest median grade</strong>.
			A candidate site's "median" means the grade where at least half of the voters give that site the median or better.
			So if 5 of 9 voters give a certain site A's and B's, its median will be B.</p>
		
		<p>Note: to simplify reporting, the grades for each candidate will be
			used to calculate a number on a scale from 0 (F) to 4 (A), using a formula
			that gives higher scores the more above-median votes a candidate has. 
			These "scores" for each candidate, along with 
            their equivalent grades, will be reported after each election.</p>
</template>

<template name="MAV_stratBlurb">
	<ul>
		<li>
			In MAV (this voting method), it is always strategic to give your favorite candidate the highest grade (A) and your
			least favorite the lowest (F).
		</li>
		<li>
			As for your second choice, you should grade it relatively low (D or F) 
			if you hope that your most-favorite option might beat it,
			but relatively high (A or B) if you fear that your least-favorite option may win.
		</li>
	</ul>

		<h3>Election Method: Graduated Majority Judgment</h3>
		<p><em>Also known as GMJ voting.</em></p>
		<h4>Ballot</h4>
		<p><strong>The ballot will ask you to grade each
		candidate</strong> (site) on a scale from A (excellent) to F (unacceptable). You may give two candidates the
		same grade if you wish. Any candidate whom you do not explicitly grade will get an F from you.</p>
		<h4>Counting</h4>
		<p>To find the winner, first the "A" votes for each candidate are counted. If no
		candidate gets over 50% of the voters, the "B" votes are added to the count, then "C"
		votes, etc. <strong>The first candidate to get over 50% is the winner.</strong>
		If two candidates would reach 50% at the same
		grade, each candidate's votes for that grade are added gradually, 
		and the winner is the one who needs the smallest portion of those votes 
		to reach 50%.</p>
		
		<p>This gradual process can be stated as a "graduated score" for each candidate. If
		a candidate reaches 50% using 8/10 of their "C" votes (along with all their A and B 
		votes), then their
		graduated score would be 1.7 (a C-). Another candidate who needed only 2/10 of their 
		"C" votes to reach 50% would have a graduated score of 2.3 (a C+), so between those 
		two candidates the second would be the winner.</p>
		
		<p>This <a href="#" class="hasPopover">formula<span class="popover">{{> GMJ_geeky}}</span></a> is most affected by the voters near the middle, not by those at the extremes.
			Thus, A, <strong>A, B, C,</strong> F would beat A, <strong>B, B, C,</strong> C.</p>

	using the formula:
		<table><tr><td rowspan="2">MedianGrade +</td><td style="text-align:center;border-bottom: solid 1px black;">NumVotesAboveMedian - NumVotesBelowMedian</td></tr>
			                                     <tr><td style="text-align:center;"><p align="center">2 * NumVotesAtMedian</p></td></tr>
		</table>
		<p>For instance, a candidate that got the grades A, A, B, B, C would have a score of</p>
		<table><tr><td rowspan="2">3 +</td><td style="text-align:center;border-bottom: solid 1px black;">2 - 1</td><td rowspan="2">= 3.25</td></tr>
			                           <tr><td>2 * 2</td></tr></table>
		<p>This formula is most affected by the voters in the middle, not by those at the extremes. 
		For instance, the candidate above would still get the same score if their lowest grade were
		changed from a "C" to an "F".</p>
