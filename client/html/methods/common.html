		<h4>Strategy note</h4>
		<em><p>Now you've had a chance to use this voting method, here are some words about voting strategy.
		"Strategy" is how you would vote if you wanted to do everything you could to maximize your faction's payoff,
		and didn't care about other factions' payoffs. Depending on the circumstances, the advice below might not
		end up helping you do that, but, unless otherwise noted, it cannot hurt.
		There is a mathematical proof (the "Gibbard-Satterthwaite theorem") that shows that any possible voting method
		will sometimes have strategies which depend on how you expect others to vote; but some methods might have
		more strategy than others.</p>
		
		<p>Not all voters are getting this advice.</p></em>
