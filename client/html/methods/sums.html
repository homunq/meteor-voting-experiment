<template name="approval_blurb">
		<h3>Election Method: Approval Voting</h3>
		<p><em>Also known as yes/no voting.</em></p>
		<h4>Ballot</h4>
		<p><strong>The ballot will ask you to approve or disapprove of each
		candidate.</strong> You may approve of any number of candidates. If you approve of all candidates or
		no candidates, your ballot will not affect the election. If you do not click either option, that
		counts as disapproval.</p>
		<h4>Counting</h4>
		<p><strong>The candidate with the most approvals wins.</strong></p>
</template>

<template name="approval_stratBlurb">
	<ul>
		<li>
			In Approval Voting (this voting method), it is always strategic to approve your favorite candidate and disapprove your
			least favorite.
		</li>
		<li>
			As for your second choice, you should approve it if you hope that your most-favorite option might beat it,
			but disapprove it if you fear that your least-favorite option may win.
		</li>
	</ul>
</template>


<template name="plurality_blurb">
		<h3>Election Method: Plurality Voting</h3>
		<p><em>Also known as First Past the Post.</em></p>
		<h4>Ballot</h4>
		<p><strong>You may vote for exactly one candidate.</strong> </p>
		<h4>Counting</h4>
			<p><strong>The candidate site with the most votes wins.</strong></p>
</template>


<template name="plurality_stratBlurb">
	<ul>
		<li>
			In Plurality Voting (this voting system), it is strategic to focus on the two candidates you think have the best
			chance of winning.
		</li>
		<li>
			Of those two, you should vote for the one you prefer.
		</li>
	</ul>
</template>

<template name="score_blurb">
		<h3>Election Method: Score Voting</h3>
		<p><em>Also known as Range Voting.</em></p>
		<h4>Ballot</h4>
		<p><strong>You may give each candidate a score from 0 (worst) to 10 (best).</strong> 
			You may give two candidates the same rating if you wish. 
			Leaving a candidate blank is equivalent to scoring them 0.</p>
		<h4>Counting</h4>
			<p><strong>The candidate with the highest total score wins.</strong></p>
</template>

<template name="score_stratBlurb">
	<ul>
		<li>
			In Score Voting (this voting method), it is always strategic to give your favorite candidate the highest score (10) and your
			least favorite the lowest (0).
		</li>
		<li>
			As for your second choice, you should grade it relatively low (0-3) if you hope that your most-favorite option might beat it,
			but relatively high (7-10) if you fear that your least-favorite option may win.
		</li>
	</ul>
</template>

<template name="SODA_blurb">
		<h3>Election Method: SODA Voting</h3>
		<p><em>SODA stands for Simple Optionally-Delegated Approval.</em></p>
		<h4>Ballot</h4>
		<p><strong>The ballot will ask you to delegate to one candidate, or approve of several candidates.</strong> 
		You may approve of any number of candidates. If you approve of all candidates or
		no candidates, your ballot will not affect the election.</p>
		<p><strong>If you check exactly one candidate, you are delegating your vote
			to that candidate.</strong> In that case, your candidate may add
		additional approvals to your ballot if, after the ballots are counted, it is clear that they cannot win. 
		This means that your delegated vote will not be wasted, even if you vote for an unpopular candidate.
		If you check more than one option, your vote will not be delegated.</p>
		<h4>Counting</h4>
			<p>All approvals are tallied for each candidate site. Separately, each candidate's delegated ballots 
				(those which approve only it) are counted.
				Then, each site, in order from most approvals to least, may, if it chooses, add its delegated
				ballot count to the
				next closest site's approval tally (as if those ballots had also approved the nearby site). 
				This will happen automatically, and the candidates are programmed
				to behave rationally, so they will only assign votes to another candidate if they cannot win themselves. 
				When this is finished, <strong>the candidate with the highest 
					final approval tally wins.</strong></p>
					
				<p>This process typically ensures that everyone who agrees with their candidate's preferences and 
					delegates their vote, has their ballot counted in favor of exactly one of the two frontrunners
					(the top two vote-getters in the final count). Thus, if all voters check one candidate each, a runoff
					election between the final frontrunners would be redundant.</p>

<template name="SODA_stratBlurb">
	<ul>
		<li>
			In SODA Voting (this voting system), it is usually strategic to delegate your vote (by checking only your favorite).
			For example, if you expect all other voters to delegate their votes, then
			it is always strategic for you to delegate too. In this case, the SODA result will be the same as if there had been a
			two-way vote between the two strongest candidates.
		</li>
		<li>
			If you believe that others will not delegate, delegating is often still best for you. However, there are cases
			where not delegating (by checking both your favorite and "Do Not Delegate") is strategic.
		</li>
	</ul>
