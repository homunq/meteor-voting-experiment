	<h2>Voting Experiment</h2>
	<p>This is an experiment on voting. 18 voters like you, divided into three groups, will
	decide between three options. Depending on the winning option, participants will 
	earn extra pay of up to
	{{bonus 6}} (paid within hours as a "bonus" in AMT). The average pay for all participants will be at least
	{{minAverage}}, and depending on your luck and skill you may earn up to 
	{{maxPay}} in total.
	We will be running this experiment several times, using
	different voting systems, but you may only participate once.</p>
	<p>In order to ensure enough simultaneous participants, we will be starting this
		experiment at a defined time. Until the countdown finishes,
		you can only view steps 0 (this screen) and 1 (consent form). Press "next" below to see the consent
		form and countdown. If you leave this
		window open, when the countdown completes, a sound will play ("voting experiment starting")
		and an "consent
		and join" button will appear. The first 18 people to press that button
		will be admitted into the experiment. We ask that you only "accept" the HIT with Amazon
		<b>after</b> you are allowed into
		the experiment. (But we have made more than 18 HITs available for idiot-proofing.)
		<b>Only the 18 workers allowed in will be paid for each run of 
		the experiment.</b></p>

	<h2>Consent statement</h2>
	<p>The following is an experiment in voting behavior. Should you choose to participate,
the experiment will take under 25 minutes total, and you will be paid a base rate of 
{{baseRate}}.
You will also have 2 opportunities to gain a reward of up to 
{{bonus 3}}. 
The average total payment of participants will be somewhere from 
{{minAverage}}
to
{{maxAverage}} 
each. Because your reward will depend on the behavior of other participants and the group
to which you are assigned, it may be impossible for you to win a reward, and so your
entire compensation could be as little as
{{baseRate}}.</p>

<p>You will gain no direct benefit from this research besides your payment and anything
you might learn about voting systems. Your actions in this experiment will be
analyzed and published to help increase scientific understanding of voter behavior.
The data will also be saved for possible comparison with future studies or other
analysis. At the end of the experiment, you will have an opportunity to opt in to
receive a short summary of the findings when available, using Mechanical Turk's
anonymous communication system; this is entirely your choice and will have no
effect on payment. Your anonymity will be safeguarded by Mechanical Turk. The
investigators will not receive any identifying information and if they do due to some
error, they will immediately destroy it. You will only be allowed to participate in this
experiment once.</p>

<p>Please understand that participation in research is completely voluntary. You are
free to decline to take part in the project. You can explicitly decline to answer any
questions without any penalty of any kind, and this assignment will still be counted
as complete on Mechanical Turk. You are free to stop taking part in the project at
any time and you will be paid based on the fraction of the allotted time you have
spent, with no bonus payments; in that case, this will count as an incomplete
assignment, but will not affect your percentage of accepted assignments.</p>

	<h1>Thank you.</h1>
	
<p>You have just participated in a study of voting systems. You learned about and participated in
one of several single-winner voting systems.</p>

<p>Many experts believe that plurality voting, the common system in which voters can choose only
one candidate, is a poor system that leads to reduced choices for voters compared to several
alternative systems. However, in order to have the confidence to move to an alternative system,
it helps to have a good understanding of how voters behave in these different systems. By
participating in this research, you have helped increase that understanding.</p>

<p>If you signed up to receive a summary of the findings of this research, when it is available,
your Amazon id will be used for this purpose. It will also be used to ensure you don't repeat the
experiment. Your ID will be kept and used only for this purpose; your privacy will be
ensured; and this is entirely at your option.</p>

<p>Thank you. If you have any questions, please contact:</p>
