	<h2>Voting Experiment</h2>
	<p>This is an experiment on voting. Groups of {{scenNumVoters}} voters like you will
	decide between three options. Depending on the winning option, participants will 
	earn a bonus of up to
	{{bonus 6}}. Since the average bonus will be at least {{minAverageBonus}}, the average total pay for 
	each participant will be at least {{minAverage}}. Depending on your luck and skill you may earn up to 
	{{maxPay}} in total.
	We will be running this experiment several times, using
	different voting systems, but you may only participate once.</p>
	<p>This experiment requires {{scenNumVoters}} simultaneous participants for each group. 
		Thus, you must take the HIT, consent, and participate
		all within a short time. If you'd rather consent before taking the HIT, that's OK too. 
		We are providing more HITs than there is actual room in the experiment, because
		we have found that some workers simply grab HITs without actually doing them immediately; such workers will
		not be paid. Once you have been assigned a slot (by clicking "consent" in step 1 after this), you will have to
		wait in step 2 until {{scenNumVoters}} subjects join the experiment, or 11 minutes pass, whichever is first. If the experiment
		does not get {{scenNumVoters}} subjects, the role of the missing subjects will be played by the computer, modeling its behavior
		on the actual subjects in other runs of the experiment.
		<b>Only the groups of {{scenNumVoters}} workers allowed in will be paid for each run of 
		the experiment.</b></p>

	<h2>Consent statement</h2>
	<p>The following is an experiment in voting behavior. Should you choose to participate,
the experiment will take under 25 minutes total, and you will be paid a base rate of 
{{baseRate}}.
You will also have 2 opportunities to gain a reward of up to 
{{bonus 3}}. 
The average total payment of each participant is expected to be somewhere between 
{{minAverage}}
and
{{maxAverage}}. 
Because your reward will depend on the behavior of other participants and the group
to which you are assigned, it may be impossible for you to win a reward, and so your
entire compensation could be as little as
{{baseRate}}.</p>

<p>You will gain no direct benefit from this research besides your payment and anything
you might learn about voting systems. Your actions in this experiment will be
analyzed and published to help increase scientific understanding of voter behavior.
The data will also be saved for possible comparison with future studies or other
analysis. At the end of the experiment, you will have an opportunity to opt in to
receive a short summary of the findings when available, using Mechanical Turk's
anonymous communication system; this is entirely your choice and will have no
effect on payment. Your anonymity will be safeguarded by Mechanical Turk. The
investigators will not receive any identifying information and if they do due to some
error, they will immediately destroy it. You will only be allowed to participate in this
experiment once.</p>

<p>Please understand that participation in research is completely voluntary. You are
free to decline to take part in the project. You can explicitly decline to answer almost any
questions without any penalty of any kind, and this assignment will still be counted
as complete on Mechanical Turk, although you will NOT be paid bonuses for any rounds
in which you do not cast a vote. The exception to this is that three of the questions in the
final survey are mandatory, and you will not be allowed to finish without answering them. The
mandatory questions do not pertain to any identifying information.</p>

researcher:</p>

	<p>Note: We are forced to make more supposed HITs available than the number of actual spaces 
		in the experiment because we
		have found that some turkers grab HITs and do not complete them immediately. Therefore,
		pressing the button below is what gets you a place in the experiment, NOT taking the HIT, 
		You may do those two things in either order, as long as you do them together reasonably quickly (in a
		matter of minutes or less.)</p>
		<p>Subjects will be accepted on a first-come, first-served basis. 
		If you receive a message about "Experiment in progress, cannot join", then there are no slots left now
		and you will have to wait hours or days until another set of experiments.

	<h1>Thank you.  To finish, click the blue "submit" button below after reading the following.</h1>
	
<p>You have just participated in a study of voting systems. You learned about and experienced using
one of several single-winner voting systems.</p>

<p>Many experts believe that plurality, the common voting method in which voters can choose only
one candidate, leads to worse outcomes and reduced choices for voters compared to several
alternative systems. However, in order to choose which of these alternatives is best,
it helps to have a good understanding of how voters will behave in each of them. By
participating in this research, you have helped increase that understanding.</p>
